# ateam-mcp — Master Plan

## Goal
Ship a working MCP server that lets any AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, Gemini) build, validate, and deploy ADAS multi-agent solutions through natural conversation. End-to-end: a developer installs it, their AI reads the spec, builds a solution, deploys it, and it runs.

---

## Completed

### Phase 1 — Stdio transport ✅
- Claude Code integration working
- All 14 tools connected and responding
- Full workflow tested: spec → validate → deploy → manage

### Phase 2 — HTTP transport (ChatGPT) ✅
- Streamable HTTP transport at mcp.ateam-ai.com
- ChatGPT "Ateam" app created and working in Developer Mode
- Fixed array schemas for ChatGPT's stricter validation

### Phase 4 — npm publish ✅
- @ateam-ai org created on npmjs.com
- Published: `@ateam-ai/mcp@0.1.3`
- Install: `npx -y @ateam-ai/mcp`

### Phase 5 — Marketplaces ✅
- **Official MCP Registry**: Published (`io.github.ariekogan/ateam-mcp`)
- **awesome-mcp-servers**: ✅ Merged — https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers/pull/2097
- **Smithery**: Published & public — https://smithery.ai/servers/ateam-ai/ateam
- **MCP Registry config**: Added to repo (`registry.yaml`), v0.1.3

### Phase 7 — Infrastructure ✅
- All services run on **mac1** (Docker + launchd agents)
- Cloudflare tunnel runs on mac1 directly
- MCP HTTP server runs on mac1 as launchd agent
- See "Infrastructure" section below for full details

## Infrastructure — What's Running on mac1

### Architecture

mac1 is the **solution host**. All backend services run there in Docker containers. The Cloudflare tunnel and MCP HTTP server run as native launchd agents on mac1.

```
Internet → Cloudflare → mac1 tunnel → localhost services
                                        ├── :3201 Skill Validator (Docker)
                                        ├── :4311 Skill Builder (Docker)
                                        ├── :4100 ADAS Core (Docker)
                                        └── :3101 MCP HTTP Server (native)
```

### Services

| Service | How it runs | What it does | Port |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cloudflare Tunnel** | launchd `com.cloudflare.cloudflared` | Routes api/mcp.ateam-ai.com → localhost | — |
| **MCP HTTP Server** | launchd `com.ateam-ai.mcp-http` | Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint for ChatGPT | 3101 |
| **Skill Validator** | Docker `adas_mcp_toolbox_builder-backend-1` | ADAS API (validates + stores skills) | 3201 |
| **Skill Builder** | Docker (same container) | Generates MCP servers from skill defs | 4311 |
| **ADAS Core** | Docker `ai-dev-assistant-backend-1` | Runs agent solutions | 4100 |

### Commands (run via `ssh mac1`)

```bash
# Check launchd services
launchctl list | grep -E 'cloudflare|ateam'

# Check Docker containers
docker ps --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}'

# Restart cloudflared
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.cloudflare.cloudflared.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.cloudflare.cloudflared.plist

# Restart MCP HTTP
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ateam-ai.mcp-http.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ateam-ai.mcp-http.plist

# View logs
tail -f /tmp/cloudflared.log
tail -f /tmp/ateam-mcp-http.log
```

### Health checks

```bash
# ADAS API (Skill Validator)
curl https://api.ateam-ai.com/health

# MCP HTTP server
curl https://mcp.ateam-ai.com/health
```

### File locations (on mac1)

- [ ] **7.2** Uptime monitoring (health checks, alerts — UptimeRobot or similar)
- [ ] **7.3** Plan migration to cloud deployment for production reliability
- [ ] **7.4** OAuth / multi-tenant support (when user demand requires per-user isolation)

### Fleet — Local File Sync
